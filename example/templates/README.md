## Templates

In this folder you will find four different templates:

* **welcome-simple** — This is a simple multi-channels template.

* **welcome-multi-channels** — Same than `welcome-simple` but loading email html from an external file.

* **welcome-css-preprocessor** — Example with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) as CSS preprocessor. You can also use less, stylus, styl, or any other preprocessor you want.

* **welcome-localized-simple** — Simple example of a localized template. You can also add your favorite l10n library.
